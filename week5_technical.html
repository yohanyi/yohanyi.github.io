			<p>Object-Oriented programming is something you’ve probably heard of. OOP is pretty straight forward. OOP is a programming principle that is based on the creation and manipulation of objects. In ruby, everything is an object. A “class” can be thought of as the blueprint of which objects are created, and just like objects in the real world they can be manipulated. A class contains methods that assign tasks or manipulate the object. You can almost view a class human, Kevin as a object that is an instance of the class human, and within the class human you can define methods such as “run”, “sleep”, and “talk”. </p>


			<p>Instance variables in ruby are variables that are available throughout all instances of the objects in a certain class. Instance variables are able to change from object to object throughout the same class. Instance variables are assigned a @ in front of the variable name.You can read more about ruby docs here:</p>
