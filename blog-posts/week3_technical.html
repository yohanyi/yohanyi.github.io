			<h2>Javascript and Web Development</h2>

			<p>Why is JavaScript popular in web development? What are the great things about JavaScript? What are it's limitations?

			If you spent some time googling "javascript" or any related keywords, you'll find how popular javascript has become in terms of web development. Javascript is a programming language that is mainly used in client-side web development. Javascript allows websites to be interactive instead of static, and has really seen a increase in it's popularity and support.

			<h2>What makes javascript so amazing?</h2>

			<p>Although there could be many reasons why many web developers believe javascript is amazing, the main ones that mostly all developers agree upon is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Speed - Javascript allows for client-side processing which makes javascript quick and painless, which in turn reduces the load on the server.</li>
				<li>All major browsers support it - There aren't too many things that are universal in programming, but Javascript is supported by ALL major browsers! This not only helps javascript in the survival of the language, but is a huge part of it's popularity and growth in the web development community.</li>
				<li>Vast libraries and open source community - Because javascript is so popular and almost necessary to create a dynamic website, the javascript has a huge open source community and a huge amount of libraries.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What are the limitations of javascript?</h2>
			<p>Like all things programming related, there is always a downside to the upside. Although it seems like the vast majority of web developers like to work with javascript and seem to think it's necessary, there are limitations on what javascript can do. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cannot access database - JavaScript alone cannot access backend databases.</li>
				<li>Security issues - because javascript is processed on the client-side, it can be used to exploit the user's system.</li>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>No matter what people's opinions are, we could clearly see that javascript is a growing language, and something an aspiring web developer must know. Whether people think javascript is the "language of the future" or a language that is soon to "die out", it is pretty obvious that currently, the use of javascript is everywhere in the world's interaction with the web.</p>
