			<h2>High Speed Internet in America</h2>
			<p>One day I was driving through some traffic, I decided to change my radio to NPR. They were having a fascinating discussion about high speed internet in America, and how America is falling behind in this topic. ISP's (Internet Service Providers) are becoming increasingly expensive, while not offering the best services for their customers. According the law professor Susan Crawford, ISP's are allowed to make deals with certain sites, allowing faster loading times for sites who pay "fee"s and slower times for sites who don't. How many times have we seen a youtube site buffer, and blame your bad internet connection? The truth is your internet connection might be completely fine, it's just youtube decided that they did not want to pay fees to ISPs to increase their loading capcities, therefore ISP's purposely provide slower speeds to certain sites. By the way, this is all LEGAL! </p>

			<p>One huge problematic reason for this internet crisis is that the FCC decided that the telecom industry would not need any regulatory oversight. They believed that capitalism and economic competition would help the industry regulate itself by forcing companies to compete and offer the best product for the best price to it's customers. Obviously, this hasn't worked. First of all, cable companies decided to divy up sections of the United States, creating local cable monopolies. As a cable user, you can simply prove this point by trying to change ISPs. You'll find that you really have no options and stuck with one general internet service provider for your area. Yes, I've tried many times to leave Time Warner Cable, but had no other options.</p>

			<p>The lack of competition between cable services and lack of government regulation created a internet market where Americans pay a very high price for slow internet. In Stockholm and Seoul, you are able to get internet which is 100 times faster, for about 1/17th the price. Yes, internet that is on average 100 times faster for less than 6% of what you are paying.</p>

			<p>To fix this problem, we need to educate the internet consumers of America. Most Americans don't even know about these dire internet problems, and how much we are getting ripped off. To fix this problem, one step would be to create a group of internet consumers who understand this situation and want to make a difference. The next step would be to have government regulation of some sort. Some rules are better than none. Cable companies should not be allowed to provide whatever service they want at whatever price they ask. How about setting national standards? How about creating a true open market where cable companies really do compete with eachother? Whatever the solution, it's clear that there is a problem and we are responsible for educating the public that this problem exists.</p>
