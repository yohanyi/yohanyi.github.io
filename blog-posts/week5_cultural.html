			<h2>Peer Pairing</h2>
			<p>I want to say that before my first pairing session, I was a bit nervous and thought to myself, "do we really need to do this?" I'm not the most outgoing guy and thought that I could learn everything just as well alone, compared to learning and pairing with others. I was wrong. My first pairing session was awesome, then the next one was just as awesome, and so far, ALL my session have been really good. Solving challenges with others
			not only increased my learning rate, but really helped because there was someone there to look at my code, catch mistakes almost instantly, and really see how other people approach problems. Peer pairing is awesome and I would definitely recommend to other programmers!
			</p>
			<p>All my feedback was positive. I really enjoyed working with others, and really forced myself to come out of my shell and take advantage of having a partner on problems. Most of them mentioned how well we communicated, and how I was willing to help and stay longer. I made a conscious decision to really get involved, and learn from my pair. Peer pairing sessions was also extra motivation for me. I didn't want to slow my partner down or become dead weight, so I would really make sure I understand the material and have a good base to ask questions off of. Writing feedback was good becuase I could really tell people how I felt about them, without having to say the comment was from me. Although, I didn't have any negative experiences, I hope that I can be more specific and actionable in my feedback. Hope to pair with everyone soon, and learn a ton from them
