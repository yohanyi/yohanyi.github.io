			<h2>Enumerable#map Method</h2>
			<p>First of all, what is an enumerable#method!? What kind of objects does it apply to? Enumerable in ruby is a module that operates all kinds methods on collections of data objects such as instances of arrays and hashes. Instead of writing conventional loops such as for loops, you can use enumerable#methods to go through each element in a data set and perform specific tasks. One of the most popular and most used Enumberable#method is the Enumberable#map. Similar to #each, the map method loops through each element and performs the block of code that follows. 
			</p>
			<h3>Difference Between #each and #map</h3>
			<p>The #each and #map methods both do perform very similar tasks. Both methods iterate over a enumberable object and then runs the block of code for each value. In other words, they perform just like any other ruby loop would. The main difference between the two methods, is that #each returns the original enumerable object it was called on, and the #map method returns the new object with the changes provided by the block of code. For example:</p>

			<p>If you want to return the original object you can use each, but if you want to return a new object with changes made by the block of code, use map!
