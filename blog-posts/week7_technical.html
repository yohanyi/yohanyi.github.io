			<h2>Issues with SQL Injection</h2>
			<p>What is it? Why is it a problem? What can newb programmers do to combat this issue?<br><br>
			SQL Injection attack is one of the most popular ways that hackers used to view, manipulate, or steal back-end data from an application. Hackers use SQL queries and commands to extract data from back-end databases without the proper validation. Sql Injection attacks allow hackers to view sensitive data such as credit card numbers, financial data, phone number, address, and other private information. Not only can hackers access this data, they can actually manipulate the database itself!</p>
			<p>How and where does SQL Injection attacks happen on an web application? <br><br>These attacks are caused by hackers inputting SQL commands or queries into areas where clients input information such as login forms, request forms, search pages, shopping carts, and pretty much anywhere where a user can input text. For example, the area where you would be inputting your login/password could be used to input SQL queries instead and these queries would allow the hacker to access the database. Instead of inputting something like "username: John Smith , password: 123", then  a hacker would input a SQL queries to access the back-end database. Even if you don't have any sensitive information in your database, you would not want someone else to be able to access your database for obvious reasons.</p>
			<p>Here's a list of methods to prevent SQL Injection:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use an input validation technique to validate for defined rules such as length, type, and syntax</li>
				<li>Users that are allowed access to any database information have very little privileges</li>
				<li>Don't use simple names for system administrator accounts</li>
				<li>Create application-specific database</li>
				<li>Use best practices in coding and sanitize code</li>
			</ul>
