			<h2>What is Rails?</h2>
				<p>Going into DBC, we've heard the words ruby on rails more than a few times. Finishing up phase 0, we all know exactly what ruby is, but what is the rails part? Rails is a web application development written in the ruby language that is use for creating web applications. Rails comes with web frameworks that allows web developers to have an already built framework to begin they're web applications. RoR is considered a backend language as you deal with data and the actual framework of the website.  You can think about rails being the blueprint to a building, while ruby is the materials used in the construction process.<br><br>

				What makes RoR (Ruby on Rails) even more popular is that is is an open source web application framework and has a strong following of users that is helping tremendously with the growth and popularity with using rails as a web framework. If you've never heard of RoR, RoR can be compared to frameworks such as CodeIgniter,Django,ColdFusion on Wheels, and many more.<br><br>
				Some popular websites built on the RoR framework:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Twitter (Initially built on RoR)</li>
					<li>Groupon</li>
					<li>Bleacher Report</li>
					<li>AirBnB</li>
					<li>Sound Cloud</li>
					<li>Hulu</li>
					<li>Github</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Although we didn't go through Rails at all during phase 0, I've come across it in articles and conversations many times. I'm excited and can't wait to learn how to use Rails!</p>
