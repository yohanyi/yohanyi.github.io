			<h2>Classes vs. Modules</h2>
			<p>To get a better understanding of what the classes and modules are in ruby, let's do a quick review of what classes are. Classes in ruby deal directly with the creation of objects, and methods to apply to each object. For example String, Integer, Hash, and array are few of the object types that are included in ruby.</p>

			<p>Everything in ruby is an object and all objects belong to classes. However, you can also create classes and create objects that are instances of your new class. Within classes, you have methods that perform certain actions on the object. If the object is NOT an instance of the class, then the class method will not work for that object. In essence, classes are about providing methods that work across a certain class type.  
			<br><br>
			On the other hand you have modules. Similarly to classes, modules provide methods that can be performed on objects. The main difference is that modules provide methods that can be used across multiple classes. Modules are just like libraries that contain methods that you can perform accross multiple classes.</p>
