			<h2>Conflicts</h2>
				<p>Conflicts happen all the time in our lives. It can arise from personal relationships. school, or work. There are many ways of handling conflicts, and the compass of shame states that there are four general methods in which people react to conflicts. The four poles of compass of shame is withdrawal, attack self, avoidance, and attack others. <br><br>


				During my time in college, I had to work on multiple group projects. There was one project that sticks out in my mind when I think about the word "conflicts". I was chosen as the project leader, and would make sure everyone knew what they were supposed to do, and that all deadlines were met. Everything was going fine until I ran into a little trouble with my part of the project. I was genuinely trying and put in the effort but just needed a little help. Then another member, we'll call him "Bob", started to talk down on me. While the other students were more than happy to lend me some help, Bob would start belittling me and start questioning my effort.<br><br>

				Looking back I could've definitely handled this better, but during those moments I decided to withdraw from the group and really was afraid to speak up and ask for help. I did my own thing, while everyone else seemed to do the same. As the leader, I should've spoken up and really explained myself better. Even after the belittling comments, I should've did something to make everyone feel more comfortable. Because I chose to withdraw, and not fix the conflict, I created an awkward situation within our group that really hurt our communication. If I could go back, I would try to let everyone know that expressing yourself is good and I would've tried become friends with Bob instead of withdrawing from the entire group.</p>
