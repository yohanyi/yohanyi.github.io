			<h2>The Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<p>The "Stereoptype Threat" is the threat of being viewed through the lense of negative streotype, or the fear of doign something to heighten a negative streotype. I am Korean-American, and faced all sorts of stereotypes growing up. Not all streotypes were negative stereotypes, but even the good ones seemed to hold some negative influences over me. For one, math came very easy and naturally to me, and I was "supposed" to be good at it, but gpa wise, math was my worst subject. I don't know if this direclty affected but, but reading through research, it makes sense that this could have had a negative effect on me.</p>
			<p>I definitely don't believe in stereoptypes and feel like everyone is extremely unique. I don't like putting myself in a box, so why would I put others in one? If I saw someone going through the "stereotype threat", I would glady stand up and speak up. Some people might stereotype unconciously and people can be negatively affected without even knowing, so I would let people know that I am uncomfortable and explain why. I hope none of this happens at DBC, and so far through my pairing session, I have seen nothing but positivity and people that are willing to learn and grow together.</p>
