			<h2>Journey to Becoming a Lifelong Learner</h2>
				<p>That was probably by far the quickest one hour video I've watched of someone talking. Wow. I though I couldn't be more excited for my future experiences at DBC. After a few minutes of watching the video, the first thought that came to me was that; DBC isn't really designed to create programming robots, but designed to turn me into a Lifelong Learner. So many things he mentioned hit a chord with me, from his views on education, to his  Kitchen vs Restaurant analogy.

				<p>I'm going to be honest, I've never been the kind of student who submits all his homework on time and studies for every test. When he mentioned that education should be something you strive for and work for, and not something someone else "shoves down your throat", really meant something. I'm working harder on phase 0 material, than I've probably ever done in a normal educational setting. Shereef made it clear that learning is not something done by a system where success is based on grades and passing tests, but learning is done by your own will, determination, hard-work, and curiosity.</p>

				<p>He also talks about exposing your ignorance, allowing others to help, and in all being humble and hungry in your learning experience. That is actually something I thought to myself before watching this video. In coming from a Finance background, I felt that maybe I'm not capable or that I will have a difficult time. I know that nothing is going to be handed to me, and I'm going to take his advice on being the best learner and programmer I could be. He put a lot of my fears going in into perspective and really put me at ease.</p>

				<p>Am I excited? More than ever. What do I think of the culture DBC is installing? I feel like this culture is something I will take with me for the rest of my life. Am I nervous? Absolutely,but what better position is there to be in, if not in an environment where there are dozens of students who just as determined or more determined, who feel the same way as I do, and students who are willing to go through this journey together side-by-side.</p>
