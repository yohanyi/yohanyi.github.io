				<p>The web page is the homepage of www.grantland.com. This page is designed to give you a quick glimpse of what this site offers such as sports stories, podcasts, and popular culture stories. Some if the visual challenges include how much text to add compared to images, and how to neatly organize dozens of links and articles.

			<h2>Geekologie</h2>

				<p>For Geekologie, I chose a webpage that shows an article or blogpost that can be accessed from the homepage. Instead of giving you glimpse of what this site offers, this page offers you the main article you chose. One of the visual challenges include how a designer would add other images/text that would keep the reader on the site. They do this well by adding a simple sidebar that includes previous stories with a small picture and minimal text underneath.

			<h2>BleacherReport</h2>

				<p>For the BleacherReport, the problem solved on this page is how current scores for the selected sport appears. One of the visual challenges is how they would set up the size of the scores layout when there are very few, or many scores. Also because there is an advertisement set on the right, how would the scores be affected by it's size. Bleacherreport seems to auto-adjust the layout to match any amount of scores, and also sets a minimum height for the advertisement to fit.
