		<h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
			<p id="intro">First off, let me introduce myself. My name is Yohan Yi and I am from Los Angeles, California. I am a recent graduate at Cal-State Fullerton with a degree in Business Administration and a concentration in Finance. Although my major in college was not technology related, I hope to to learn and build my skills in web developing. </br>I'm very excited and can't waite to start my journey to becoming the best programmer I can be!

		<h2><b>DBC Expectations</b></h2>
			<p>I'm very excited and nervous for my experience at DBC. There are a lot of variables that I can't control, but I'm more motivated than ever, and willing to give it my all. I love solving problems and thrive when I'm faced with challenges that are difficult. More than solving problems alone, I love solving the with a team of people that are as dedicted or even more dedicated than I am.
