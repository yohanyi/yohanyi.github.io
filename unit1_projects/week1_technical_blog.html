			<h2><a href="grantland.com" target="_blank">GRANTLAND</a></h2>
				<p>One of my favorite sites to surf throughout the day is www.grantland.com. The first thing that catches my eye when look at the homepage are the pictures of sports and a T.V show. The two large pictures that catch my eye is a picture of Lebron James, and a picture of Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones. Yes, I know what you're thinking. Can there be a more entertaining combo than basketball and GoT? I don't know if the pictures would be considered the most important aspects of the website, but they definitely do give you a great feel for what this site offers. With a perfect mixture of popular culture, sports, and great blogging. If I had to visually describe this site with 5 adjectives, they would be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Classy</li>
					<li>Simple</li>
					<li>Organized</li>
					<li>Plain Colors</li>
					<li>Abundant</li>
				</ul>
				<p>On the other hand If I were to choose 5 adjectives to describes the content and purpose they would be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Interesting</li>
					<li>Sports and Popular Culture</li>
					<li>Clever</li>
					<li>Informative</li>
					<li>Balanced</li>
				</ul>
				<p>With the two lists, you can get a good grasp of what the site offers. Although because of the sheer abundance of writers and stories, you may not be able to go through the whole site in one sitting. Instead I can be certain you will find a great balance of popular culture, sports, podcasts of many different types of topics, in a very neat and organized manner. The tan background gives the site a plain and classy look to give it a classy feel. On top of that you get great balance amazing writers and bloggers who give you their real opinions! Let me make this clear, this is not a site that delivers news, but delivers stories and opinions. I'll leave you with a link to two of my favorite articles:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://grantland.com/features/how-annoy-fan-base-60-easy-steps/">Mistakes made by Golden State Warriors</a> (Yes, I am a Lakers fan but I mean NO offense).</li>
					<li><a href="http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-if-i-fought-this-rapper-would-i-win-chart/">Which Rapper would you Fight?</a> (As a fan of rap music just thought this was a great read)</li>
				</ol>

			<h2><a href="geekologie.com" target="_blank">GEEKOLOGIE</a></h2>
				<p>Another one of my favorite sites is www.geekologie.com. This is another one of my favorite blog based sites that I like to visit. The first thing that my eyes are drawn too when taking a quick glance at the homepage, is the title. No other word gets me as excited as the word "GEEK". Simply based off the title, you know your in for a treat. Visually I would say this site is:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Simple</li>
					<li>Dark</li>
					<li>Efficient</li>
					<li>Trendy</li>
					<li>Engaging</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I simply love how Geekologie is set up. You simply scroll through a bunch of articles, and each article contains a title, large picture, and right below that a paragraph or two to give you some idea of what the article contains. The writers for this blog are very humorous and sarcastic. Some of the posts might come off offensive, but it makes for a great read. After a while, you definitely might feel like you wasted a bunch of time! You definitely won't agree with all of content and comments, but this site is definitely has some interesting content that can be geeky, humorous, and very sarcastic. I'll leave you with a couple of my favorite recent posts:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://geekologie.com/2014/05/all-the-rage-dogs-dyed-to-look-like-pand.php" target="_blank">Panda Dogs</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://geekologie.com/2014/05/ultra-fast-reacting-robotic-hand-can-cat.php" target="_blank">Ultra Fast Robot</a></li>
				</ol>

			<h2><a href="bleacherreport.com" target="_blank">BLEACHERREPORT</a></h2>
				<p>My go to website for sports news is www.bleacherreport.com. BleacherReport is a site that is comparable to www.espn.com, but I like BleacherReport far better for a few reasons. Unlike the previous two sites, this site mainly delivers sports news, and is not blog based. The first thing you might notice is the very colorful background they use, and the fact that the background changes often depending on what's going on in the sports world. Visually, this site is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Colorful</li>
					<li>Simple(compared to other sports news sites)</li>
					<li>Organized</li>
					<li>Enticing</li>
					<li>Modern</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The content and focus of the website can best be described as:<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sports highlights and news</li>
					<li>Practical</li>
					<li>Abundant</li>
					<li>Informational</li>
					<li>Up-to-date</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Finding content and news on this website is as easy as clicking on the sport your interested in. 
				What I love about this site, compared to other sites like ESPN, is the simplicity of the homepage. On the right you have a "Headlines" box, that has the main headlines of the day, and right below that, there is a list of the top 10 most popular stories. The top 10 list is my favorite aspect of this site. This site is definitely informative and practical if you are curious about what's going on in the sports world. Plus, they take their time to change the backgrounds relating to sports events that are currently happening!</p>
