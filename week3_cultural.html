			<h2>Getting My Mind Right</h2>
				<p>This was the first time I ever took any quizzes that related to how I learn or what type of thinker I am. The tests were very helpful in generalizing what kind of learner I was, but it simply was a generalization. There were aspects of these tests I agreed with, and some aspects I disagreed with. I believe we are all unique individuals, with unique learning styles that cannot be generalized into a certain "type" of learner or thinker. These tests were helpful but in no way were these tests a pure indication of what kind of person you are. 
				<br><br>
				For my thinking style quiz, I tested into the abstract random category. The website states that a person that identifies himself or herself in the Abstract Random Thinkers category organizes information through reflection, thrive in unstructured and people oriented environments. I agree with this notion. I do believe I learn best when I'm amongst other people, interacting and asking questions. I love the freedom of just bouncing back and forth ideas while learning. I feel that this is a perfect fit for DBC, as we will be working with fellow cohorts in a generally free working environment where we are allowed to really learn and grow amongst our cohorts. Although I tend to agree with this assessment, I feel like that is not the only thinking style I have. I love to experiment in my learning, which would put in in the Concrete Random category. There is no "one" category I belong in, but I'm a mixture of many, and I plan to really learn more about myself as a thinker during my DBC journey.
				<br><br>
				For my VARK learning style, I got multimodal with kinesthetic and aural as my two types of styles. The kinesthetic style states that I should be really submerging myself in the topics I am studying, by interacting physically with the topic through people, experiments, and applications. I definitely agree with this assessment, and this is one of the reasons I chose to attend a physical bootcamp instead of learning online. I <b>NEED</b> to be in an environment where learning comes from interaction with people, teachers, cohorts, and applications. I thrive in situations where learning is done in groups and learning is done by both listening and taking in ideas, but also speaking and articulating your own ideas. 
				<br><br>
				My second learning style was Aural. Aural is similar to kinesthetic because aural states that I take in information best when it is discussed and communicated verbally. Even as a college student, I knew that this was my style of learning and really adapted my style of education to aural. Some students never went to class, and managed to read all the material and study through power points, but I knew that wasn't my style. I always knew that if I were to be successful in college, I needed to attend all the classes and really interact with my professor vocally. This works perfect for my plans at DBC. I know that the majority of the time at DBC we will have both teachers and fellow cohorts to learn from!
				<br><br>
				I want to really adapt and remind myself what it takes to get in the Growth Mindset versus the Fixed Mindset. I know that intelligence can be developed, and shouldn't fear my capabilities compared to other students who are more advanced in programming than I am. I know that with hard work and dedication, especially being surrounded by those who have the same drive, I can thrive and really become an awesome programmer. I've always took criticism really well, and learn a lot from that and I plan to adapt that to my DBC journey. Although sometimes I feel like I like in the "intelligence" department compared to other advanced programmers, I know that I don't lack in my drive. I love challenges and embrace them. I look forward to really accelerating my learning by strengthening my weaknesses, and increasing my strengths in all learning styles and mindsets.</p>
