			<h2>Classes vs. IDs</h2>
				<p>If you did some basic HTML and CSS, you probably came across many div tags in a single HTML file. If you already don't know by now, the div tag is simply a tag that defines a section of the HTML code. Div are primarily used to break up a HTML file into specific sections in order to apply the proper CSS to each division. A very simple example of divisions within a HTML could include a header, content, and footer.</p>

				<p>Now that you have your HTML page separated into sections using the div tag (there are other methods of sectioning portions of HTML but we'll keep it simple and assume we're going to use the div tags), we can now give them a class or id name to go with it. The id name or class name should generally give you an idea of what the section contains, or what you plan to do to it's CSS. Note that in CSS classes are styled using .nameClass and ids are styled by using #nameID. So now the big question, when do we use classes vs ids?</p>

				<p>The main difference in the ids and classes are the ID's are unique, meaning there can be exactly one element with that specific ID, while there can be multiple instances of the same classes. Just imagine a student in school. A specific student can be in many different classes, such as the class of 2007, in Mrs. Hotdog's class, and in band class. There can also be multiple students that have the same exact classes! On the other hand, ID's are unique. Each student gets only one, and no two student should have the same ID#. Some examples of ID's are header and footer. There should be no more than one header, and footer in a given html file. On the other hand, some examples of classes include "center" or "important". You can have many elements you want to center, and many important elements in a given HTML file. You can have elements with BOTH id's and classes, and you can have multiple classes for an element!</p>
