			<h2>Importance of Values</h2>
			<p>When I think back on my proudest accomplishemnts of my life, the values that come to my mind are , <b>ambition, relationships, development, and preseverance.</b> Although there are many more words that can be used to describe moments of accomplishments, those words stand out the most to me. Ambition is what keeps me motivated to move forward and achieve goals. I always make goals, and make plans to achieve them. This way there is a feeling of accomplishment once your goal is achieved. I chose relationships because, I believe no matter how ambitious you are, you will not get far without meeting new people and creating relationships with them. Relationships are how you grow and learn as a person, and can positively affect your life in many ways. There are too many friends, family members, and mentors to thank for my accomplishments. I also chose development becuase, the word sums up what you strive to accomplish in all aspects of your life. You want to develop into a better, smarter, kinder, and friendlier person. You always want to better yourself, and those around you. Lastly, I chose preseverance because sometimes you'll fail, and stumble in your life journies. Failure is not the end, just another stepping block to success. I don't believe in giving up, and I don't believe in negativity. For these reasons, I strongly try to live up to these values and make them very important in my life.</p>
			<p>The last time a friend asked me for advice, the problem dealt with preseverance. He felt that he did not understand a certain topic, and felt that he wasn't able to solve it. Instead, of giving him the answer to the problems, I simply told him to ask as many questions as possible. I told him he should ask me, other friends, and use the internet whenever possible. I felt his problem was that he never asked questions, and assumed he could figure it out on his own. Being humble is another word that could be used to describe another value in my life and my life accomplishments.</p>
			<p>When I think about my values, the one attribute that is present in all my values is <b>positivity</b>. Being positive in all aspects of life, is the single most important value to me. I don't dwell on negative thoughts, and definitely don't encourage negativity in any way. I definitely think that this can help me mediate streotype threat if I feel like that's what is going on. I feel uncomfortable when that happens and have no choice but to speak up on the issue. Everyone deserves respect, and that includes yourself also. When I'm feeling down, I like to look up quotes online that deal with my situation. I'll change my background on my desktop to include that quote, so I'm reminded of the positive feelings even though I'm not feeling too positive. Another method I use when feeling down, is simply talking. Talking about your problems not only relieves stress, many times it could solve the issues or help you come up with solutions. All you need is a friend you trust and willingness to open up.</p>
